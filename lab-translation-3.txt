Lab : App Dev: Setting up a Development Environment v1.1 
Overview

In this lab, you will provision a Google Compute Engine virtual machine and install software libraries for Node.js software development on Google Cloud Platform.

Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

    -Provision a Google Compute Engine instance.

    -Connect to the instance using SSH.

    -Install software on the instance.

    -Verify the software installation.

	Task 1 Creating a Compute Engine Virtual Machine Instance
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a
gcloud compute instances create dev-instance --machine type "n1-standard-1" --tags http  --scopes compute-rw,storage-ro
gcloud compute firewall-rules create my-firewall-rule --action= Allow destination= ingress --rules http:80 --target-tags= http
		SSH INTO YOUR VM
gcloud compute ssh dev-instance
	Task 2:Install software on the VM instance
In the SSH session, to update the Debian package list, execute the following command
sudo apt-get update
To install Git, execute the following command
sudo apt-get instsll git 
if propmted press Y the enter
To download the Node.js setup script, execute the following command
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
To install npm and Node.js, execute the following command
sudo apt install nodejs
	Task 3: Configure the VM to Run Application Software
To check the version of Node.js, execute the following command
node -v
You should see the Node.js version number for version 6
To clone the class repository, execute the following command
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst
To change the working directory, execute the following command
cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/developingapps/nodejs/devenv/
To run a simple web server, execute the following command
sudo node server/app.js
To stop the application use ctrl-c
To install the Node.js library for Compute Engine, execute the following command
npm install
To run a simple Node.js application that lists Compute Engine instances, execute the following command
node list-gce-instances.js
